# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our software seriously. If you suspect that you have found a vulnerability in this project, please report it immediately.

**DO NOT** open a public issue. Publicly verifying a vulnerability may allow malicious actors to exploit it before a fix is available.

Instead, please send a report to the maintainer:

* **Email:** erodrigov7@gmail.com
* **Subject:** [SECURITY] Vulnerability Report - Locus API

I will try to review your report within 48 hours and provide a fix as soon as possible.
